<p> Treasure Art Studio strives to foster the imagination and creativity of children through storybooks
  and art classes. Founded by Louisa Kwan-Shabani, the studio embraces the vision
that "every child is potentially the light of the world" creating art experiences
for children to assist in training them and helping to reveal their inner treasures. </p>

<h1 style = "font-size: 30px"> Our Teachers </h1>
<p> Our teachers are both passionate about art and children's education.
  Trained in both visual arts and design, with the experience of training young children,
  our teachers strive to create an environment that is most enriching for the child
  to explore different mediums within different contexts. Our teachers all hold a Victorian Working With Children's
  Check and have public liability insurance.

<h1 style = "font-size: 30px"> Our Class </h1>
  <p>Every Saturday during school term, 9am - 10am at Clota Cottage in Box Hill,
    we host a small size art class particularly for young children from 4 years old. It is a multi-age class
    for beginners as well as those children with more experience in making art.
    The classes explore different methods such as drawing, painting, modelling, papercraft and more.
    Drop into one of our classes if you feel your child would like to make more art during their school term!
